# Unofficial-EV-KIT-laser-sensor-documentation
Unofficial and TRUE documentation for the EVKIT laser distance sensor of Egismos

**WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT HESITATE TO HELP ME, PULL REQUEST ARE WELCOME :D**

He're an other documentation based on the original availlable on [the Egismos website](http://www.egismos.com/laser-distance-module-2M-60M-BT) with code example (Python 2.7 and C# using winform) and things explained, plus, I'm planning to create an other android application to use it. 

### Why this documentation ? 

The original is unclear with bad translations and concrete examples to use this sensor properly are missing.

If you want to help me, here's [the to-do list](https://github.com/TuxSeb/unofficial-EV-KIT-laser-sensor-documentation/issues)

### About it:

* This documentation will support both bluetooth and RS232 version of the sensor, in order to not let someone down 
* Whether it is the 30, 60 or 100 meters sensor, that does not change anything about how to use it.
